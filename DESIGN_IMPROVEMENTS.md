- **Animation System**: Comprehensive animation library with easing functions

### Design Tokens
```css
/* Colors */
primary: { 50-950 } - Blue-based primary palette
secondary: { 50-950 } - Gray-based secondary palette
accent: { 50-950 } - Purple-based accent palette
success: { 50-950 } - Green-based success palette
warning: { 50-950 } - Yellow-based warning palette
error: { 50-950 } - Red-based error palette

/* Typography */
font-family: Inter (primary), JetBrains Mono (monospace)
font-size: xs, sm, base, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl, 4xl, 5xl, 6xl
line-height: Optimized for readability

/* Spacing */
spacing: 18, 88, 128 (custom values)
border-radius: xl (0.75rem), 2xl (1rem), 3xl (1.5rem)

/* Shadows */
soft: Subtle shadow for cards
medium: Medium shadow for elevated elements
large: Strong shadow for modals/overlays
glow: Colored glow for active states
```

### Animation System
```css
/* Keyframes */
fadeIn: Smooth opacity transition
slideUp: Slide up with opacity
slideDown: Slide down with opacity
